Solves the 2-by-2 Rubik's cube from any given scramble using the old pochmann's method.

It is assumed that the green side faces the front and the white side faces the top.

Uses standard notation for moves:
R - turn the face that faces the right clockwise,
R' - turn the face that faces the right counterclockwise,
U - turn the face that faces up clockwise,
U' - turn the face that faces up counterclockwise.
Similarly, L refers to left, D refers to down, F refers to front, and B refers to back.
